peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will graze that peer-to-peer multiplayer lawn like Jesus calls his sheep

so, you wanna be a peer-to-peer-hero, kid?
well - whoop-de-doo
i have been around the decentralized-block before
with moneyheads just like you
each and every one a coins-demo-experimental-disappointment
human-concerns-pain for which there ain't no ointment
so much for livelyhood-excuses, though a kid of Jesus's Father
is aksing me to jump into the DHT-programming fray
my answer is two words -
o k

use your head! - i will be multiplayer peer-to-peer 1v1 real-time game of Word
  it's a daunting wall to climb - but i will free-solo with passion like Alex-Honnold El-Sendero-Luminosa
i will take best from
  Top Gear - i am a special, i have no tabs
  tennis - be 1v1 and simple
  Starcraft - be real-time with bo3 bo5 sets
  torrent - be peer-to-peer
  ipfs - be peer-to-peer in real-time
i will use no canvas
  i'm a game of words
i will be entirely free
  no money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-bounties-coins-fundings
  no issue-disussion scrathcing on top of our heads
  no Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will walk in sandals whole year round
  simple as Game-Changers - i release a .jar
  a whole foods plant based vegan .jar of beskar parens ( )
  birds and Pain and Panic have figured out not to carry house around but migrate twice a year towards summer
  and we are better than birds
i will freely choose one network i will use
  plain as Cowspiracy - i choose food for dish not dish for food
i will be desktop
  no mobile greesy-young-Forest-Gump fingers
  there is no reason for imprisoning people into Brennan-Chapelle-Half-Baked device and OS
  a light laptop is like sandals - the only driod a person needs - no contirbuting to imadness


i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Djokovic-Nadal competition
  while staying focused on the mission - dont want to found another academy
  too many academies - not enough programs
i need a repository named Philoctetes - like Commander-Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Philoctetes
      email = Philoctetes@ooptie-doo
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues wikis projects tabs
i will be programmed by one person only
  i trust Hermes with it - he also wears sandals
  and will deliver the message without settling down on the way
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot

i need Hermes to stay guest at a house - like Tallahassee welcomes Columbus to tag along
he needs a place on the floor to crash and a shower - he comes late leaves early 
Hermes spends his day in moving between public libraries and stores, on sport-esport events
he needs no money - only freedom to assemble his daily meal for himself
he does not cook - in words of Hela - darling, you have no idea what's possible
Hermes walks in sandals whole year round - cause he's smarter than a bird and is where summer
he is now in a store near hear - https://goo.gl/maps/H52FKc8sFTYjnp9y7
he knows where he's staying tonight - but he's ready to move and is not settling

to be a true hero, kid - is a dying art - like painting a masterpiece, it's a work of heart
